# Changelog

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.8.2 ( October 19th, 2022 )

- Added the ability to prevent the automatic loading of WebID's and Profiles from SessionProvider, this is useful when building provisioning applications where the user has logged in, but doesn't yet have a WebID or Pod or Profile documents.
- Fixed issue with sourcemaps not being included in our package tarballs

## 2.8.1 ( October 10, 2022 )

- Upgrade Inrupt SDKs to latest versions
- Upgrade typescript to ^4.8.4, this should help with sporadic issues with mismatches in the `fetch` type definitions

## 2.8.0 ( June 6, 2022 )

### Breaking Changes

- Support for Node.js v12.x has been dropped as that version has reached end-of-life.

### Bugfixes

- When `Image` component is editable, the value error will be set if there is no image available, which means the error component (default or custom) wis displayed correctly.

### Other Changes

- This release also significantly upgrades the dependencies used by this package.

## 2.7.0 ( January 20, 2022 )

### New features

- The `Image` component now takes an optional prop `allowDelete`, which renders a default delete button that will remove the value from the dataset. It is also possible to pass a `deleteComponent` to render a custom delete button in place of the default.

## 2.6.1

### New features

- The `Image` component now allows for a new image to be saved even if the property is not found in the dataset, by passing a `solidDataset` where the Thing should be set after updating, and a `saveLocation` where the image file should be stored.

### Bugfixes

- The webpack export now works properly for some otherwise-broken webpack-using projects.

## 2.6.0 ( November 22, 2021 )

### New features

- The `SessionContext` now has a `profile` property which contains the user's profiles.

## 2.5.1 ( October 25, 2021 )

- Upgrade dependencies, including solid-client and solid-client-authn

## 2.5.0 ( September 15, 2021 )

- Add `FileUpload` component.

## 2.4.2 ( August 20, 2021 )

- Change build target from commonjs to umd, to fix webpack issues

## 2.4.1 ( August 18, 2021 )

- Fix missing code snippets in storybook
- Fix dependencies to work with React 17

## 2.4.0 ( July 23, 2021 )

- `useFile` hook added.

- `Table` now takes an optional `emptyStateComponent` to be rendered if no rows are present.

- `TableColumn` now takes an optional `sortFn` sorting function used to sort that column.

- The following components now take an optional `loadingComponent` to be rendered while fetching data:
  - `Value`
  - `Text`
  - `Link`
  - `Image`
  - `Video`
- When it is not passed, the components render a default message instead.
- If `null`, the default message won't be rendered.

- The following components now take an optional `errorComponent` to be rendered in case of error:
  - `Value`
  - `Text`
  - `Link`
- When it is not passed, the components render a default message instead.
- `DatasetProvider` still receives this now as `loadingComponent`.
- `CombinedProvider` now receives this prop and passes it down to the `DatasetProvider`.

## Deprecations

- `loading` in `DatasetProvider` is now deprecated and replaced with `loadingComponent` to match the rest of the components. `loading` can still be used in `DatasetProvider` but may be removed in a future major release.

The following sections document changes that have been released already:

## 2.3.1 ( June 9, 2021 )

### Bugs fixed

- The `Value` component now handles the case where `datetime-local` is unsupported by the browser and renders two inputs with type `date` and `time` instead.
- Updated @inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser, which was causing an issue where `SessionContext`'s `sessionRequestInProgress` property would not be set to `false` properly in some cases.

## 2.3.0 ( May 31, 2021 )

### Changed

- The `SessionProvider` component now accepts additional variables to enable
  logging back in on refresh.

## 2.2.0 ( May 19, 2021 )

### Changed

- Updated all dependencies, including @inrupt/solid-client from 1.3.0 to 1.6.1, and @inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser from 1.5.1 to 1.8.0

## 2.1.0 ( January 14, 2021 )

### Changed

- If no `onError` is passed to a SessionContext, an error will be thrown
- `login` from `useSession` will now throw errors if an error occurs
- Only `Enter` keyboard events will trigger login and logout on the default
  LoginButton and LogoutButton
- Packages have been upgraded - notably, `@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser` which allows
  refreshing without losing the current session

## 2.0.0 ( November 6, 2020 )

### BREAKING

- `dataset` property replaced by `solidDataset` in components so that the property would not
  conflict with intrisic HTML element attributes.
- Components such as `text` and `value` no longer throw errors if something goes wrong during
  reading or saving, and instead always call `onError` if provided.

### Added

- All components which previously took a `property` prop now can optionally accept a
  `properties` prop instead, which will be an ordered list of properties to attempt to read and
  write from. If none of the properties have values, the first will be used if editing data.
