# useThing

A hook to access the nearest [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) from context if no arguments are supplied, or to request a [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) from a given [IRI](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-IRI).

Should be located within a [`SessionProvider`](/?path=/docs/authentication-session-provider) if using to fetch.

```
const { thing, error } = useThing(datasetIri, thingIri, options)
```

## Parameters

- `datasetIri`: (optional) a [Dataset](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-SolidDataset) [IRI](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-IRI) to fetch the [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) from, if both `datasetIri` and `thingIri` are supplied. Uses the [Dataset](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-SolidDataset) from context if omitted.
- `thingIri`: (optional) a [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) [IRI](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-IRI) to fetch the [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) from. Uses the [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) from context if omitted.
- `options`: (optional) additional options to pass to the [dataset request](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/modules/_resource_soliddataset_.html#getsoliddataset), if `datasetIri` is supplied. Unless an alternative id provided, `options.fetch` is included using the current session automatically.

## Return Values

- `thing`: the [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing) retrieved from context or requests using given [IRI](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-IRI) (undefined if loading/missing)
- `error`: the error thrown by the request (or undefined)

## Example Usage

This example uses the datasetIri and thingIri values to fetch a [Thing](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/reference/glossary/#term-Thing), and pass to a child component when loaded.

<Source
  code={`
import { useThing } from "@inrupt/solid-ui-react";
import Profile from "../components";
function ProfileLoader() {
  const datasetIri = "https://example.com/profile";
  const thingIri = "https://example.com/profile#me";
  const { thing, error } = useThing(datasetIri, thingIri);
  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>;
  if (!thing) return <div>loading...</div>;
  return <Profile profile={thing} />;
}
`}
