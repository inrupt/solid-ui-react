# Getting Started

In this guide, we will:

1. Cover how to use storybook
1. Register a pod

## Using Storybook

From the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) homepage:

> Storybook is an open source tool for developing
> UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. It makes
> building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

In particular, we are using it so that we can show live examples, rather than
simply documentation. To navigate storybook, click on any of the pages on the
left column to view a component or page. Some components may have multiple
examples that you can click through as well.

On the top of each component example are multiple tools: "Canvas", which
displays the rendered component, and "Docs", which contains the various
properties that may be applicable to the component.

Additionally, on the top-right of the screen, are three buttons. The middle,
"open in new tab", will be necessary to test out the authentication components.
(For security reasons, most identity providers do not allow logging in in an
iframe, so the page must be opened in a tab.)

Some components may have multiple tabs along the bottom of the screen: "Actions",
"Controls", and "Story." "Actions" is a list of callbacks that have happened-
for example, an `onSave` or `onError` event. Components with "Controls" allow you
to change parameters and see the effects live. Finally, "Story" contains the
source of the example.

## Registering a Pod

You can visit [inrupt.net](https://www.inrupt.net) to register a new pod,
whether for personal use or development. Once you've logged in, you will
see an interface which allows you to view and edit the data in your pod.
