# Solid React SDK - solid-ui-react

`solid-ui-react` is a library of React components made to make development
with [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) simple.

The goal of this library is to provide highly flexible, simple components that
you can use in any browser-based Solid project and customize to match the UI of
your application. It uses the
[Inrupt Javascript Client Libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/)
for authentication and data manipulation. It is built with typescript and
exports its types.

In this library, you will find:

- Authentication components, which can help you log in and log out of an identiy
  provider
- Data components, which can help you view and edit individual properties or
  view a sortable and filterable table of many things
- Context providers and hooks to help simplify development when using functional
  programming

You can view the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react), or
[view an example application](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react-example-project).
