# solid-ui-react

In this guide, we will:

1. Set up authentication
1. View and edit data in your user profile

You can also view an example application
[on GitHub](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-ui-react-example-project).

## Authentication

Once you have created a react application, allowing users to register or log in
is simple. You will want to install the SDK:

```
npm i -S @inrupt/solid-ui-react
```

And then import two components:

```
import { SessionProvider, LoginButton } from "@inrupt/solid-ui-react";
```

You can then wrap your application in the SessionProvider that you imported.
Give it a unique sessionId. Finally, anywhere in your component tree, as long
as you have a SessionProvider above it, you can use a
[LoginButton](/?path=/story/authentication-login-button--with-children).

```
<SessionProvider sessionId="some-id">
  <LoginButton
    oidcIssuer="https://inrupt.net"
    redirectUrl="https://localhost:3000/"
  />
</SessionProvider>
```

From there, you can click "login" to be redirected to the OIDC issuer provided.
You can either log in or register a pod once redirected to the identity provider's
login page.

## Reading and Writing Data

Now that you have a pod, you can begin reading data. To do this, we will import
another pair of components: a `CombinedDataProvider`, which will handle fetching
a dataset for you, and a `Text` component to display that data.

```
import { useSession, CombinedDataProvider, Text } from "@inrupt/solid-ui-react";
```

In your component tree, still within the context of the `SessionProvider`, first
you can read the WebId of your session with the `useSession` hook.
A WebId is a URL that links to the profile document stored in your pod -
which was likely automatically generated for you. A CombinedDataProvider can
then use that WebId to automatically fetch data, and the Text component can display
that data.

For further information on "datasets" and "things", refer to the
[solid-client-js documentation](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/).

```
function Name() {
  const { session, sessionRequestInProgress } = useSession();
  if (sessionRequestInProgress) return "Loading...";

  const webId = session.info.webId;

  <CombinedDataProvider datasetUrl={webId} thingUrl={webId}>
    <Text propertyUrl="http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#fn" />
  </CombinedDataProvider>
}
```

The `Text` component, like most other data components, will automatically refer
to a DatasetContext or CombinedDataContext if there is one in the heirarchy. This
code will display your full name (assuming a standard profile).

To edit this data, set the `edit` and `autosave` properties to true, which will
replace the text with an input box. With `autosave`, the data will be automatically
saved back to the server when you click outside of the textbox:

```
function Name() {
  const { session, sessionRequestInProgress } = useSession();
  if (sessionRequestInProgress) return "Loading...";

  const webId = session.info.webId;

  <CombinedDataProvider datasetUrl={webId} thingUrl={webId}>
    <Text propertyUrl="http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#fn" edit autosave />
  </CombinedDataProvider>
}
```

View the Component documentation for more examples, such as for images, links,
and non-string values such as booleans and datetimes.
